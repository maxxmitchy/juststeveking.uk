                                Prior to this I was using a custom built AlphaSync Windows PC with an AMD Ryzen 9. This new machine is faster, quieter and does not heat up at all.
                                It also has the added benefit of mac OS development experience which I believe is second to none.

                                This is my latest "toy", an ultra wide screen monitor that allows me to have an uninterupted view on code, web and terminal all in one. My productivity has increased quite a bit since using this, and I have to say it is all thanks to this monitor allowing me to tweak my layout exactly as I need it. The quality is also fantastic, however I always keep the monitor in eye saver mode which is a slightly dimmed version.

                                I have recently upgraded my headset after using my Google Pixel Buds for quite some time. I loved using my Pixel Buds, but the battery life often was not enough for an entire stream, even after a full charge. So I have recently upgraded to a gaming headset which has a 16 hour charge - which should be much better. It also features directional sound microphone so hopefully it mutes out some noise from the keyboard too.

                                I have recently upgraded to the keychron k2 after getting loads of advice on these keyboards. It is a little more compact than I am used to, but I will adjust soon enough. I am currently using the blue switches, which are the loadest that keychron have, but am testing them out before I move to a different set - I have been advised to use Red switches as they are quieter.

                                I used to use the built in terminal for mac, however since switching to using the Warp terminal I have been more productive and find terminal usage increasingly easier. It works like a combined text editor and terminal, has workflows, and the input stacys at the bottom of the screen so it feels more natural to use.

                                For PHP developers tinkerwell is a no-brainer. It allows you to test and write snippets quickly, evaluate then, refactor them, then pop the back in your application easily. At such a low price, it is worth the money for definite.

                                As it states on the website "The no-bull Laravel tool" and it is true. I can run artisan commands, open an interactive tinker session, run my test suites - all on local and production servers. Making aplication management super easy.

                                If you are building applications that send transactional emails, or emails in general HELO is a fantastic product. It acts as a local mail trap with as many mailboxes as you need for free, allowing you to catch and test email functionality.
